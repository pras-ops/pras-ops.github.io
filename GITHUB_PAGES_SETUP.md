# GitHub Pages + Custom Domain Setup Guide

## âœ… Complete Solution Implemented

Your React app is now configured with the **optimal solution** for GitHub Pages + GoDaddy custom domain:

### What's Been Set Up

1. **404.html Fallback** - Created in `public/404.html` (identical to `index.html`)
2. **Package.json Configuration** - Added `homepage` field and `build:gh-pages` script
3. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Automatic deployment with 404.html fallback creation
4. **Vite Configuration** - Optimized for GitHub Pages deployment

## ðŸš€ Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **Pages** section in left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. The workflow will automatically deploy when you push to main

### 2. Configure Custom Domain in GitHub

1. In the same **Pages** section:
   - Add `prashant-j.com` in the **"Custom domain"** field
   - Click **Save**
   - Wait for DNS check to pass
   - Enable **"Enforce HTTPS"** (may take a few minutes)

### 3. Verify DNS Configuration in GoDaddy

Your DNS should have these records:

**A Records** (for apex domain `prashant-j.com`):
```
prashant-j.com â†’ 185.199.108.153
prashant-j.com â†’ 185.199.109.153
prashant-j.com â†’ 185.199.110.153
prashant-j.com â†’ 185.199.111.153
```

**CNAME Record** (for www subdomain, optional):
```
www â†’ pras-ops.github.io
```

### 4. Deploy Your Site

```bash
# Commit and push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Build your Vite app
- Create 404.html fallback
- Deploy to GitHub Pages

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### Client-Side Routing Solution

1. **Normal Navigation**: When users click links in your app, React Router handles routing client-side
2. **Direct URL Access**: When someone visits `/blog/chrome-web-store-review` directly:
   - GitHub Pages looks for that file
   - File doesn't exist, so serves `404.html`
   - `404.html` loads your React app
   - React Router sees the URL and renders the correct component

### Why This Solution is Optimal

âœ… **Better than HashRouter**: Clean URLs without `#` symbols  
âœ… **SEO Friendly**: Search engines can crawl your routes properly  
âœ… **No Code Changes**: Your existing React Router setup works as-is  
âœ… **Automatic**: GitHub Actions handles deployment and 404.html creation  
âœ… **Custom Domain Ready**: Works perfectly with your GoDaddy domain  

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Setup

After deployment, test these scenarios:

1. **Homepage**: `https://prashant-j.com/` âœ…
2. **Direct Route Access**: `https://prashant-j.com/blog/chrome-web-store-review` âœ…
3. **Another Route**: `https://prashant-j.com/transcript-extractor` âœ…
4. **Navigation**: Click links within your app âœ…

All should work seamlessly!

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If Direct URLs Still Show 404

1. **Check GitHub Actions**: Go to Actions tab, ensure deployment succeeded
2. **Verify 404.html**: Check that `dist/404.html` exists in your repository
3. **DNS Propagation**: Wait up to 24 hours for DNS changes to propagate
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or try incognito mode

### If HTTPS Doesn't Work

1. **Wait for DNS**: HTTPS can take 24+ hours to activate
2. **Check GitHub Settings**: Ensure "Enforce HTTPS" is enabled
3. **Verify CNAME**: Make sure `CNAME` file contains `prashant-j.com`

## ðŸ“‹ Summary

Your setup now includes:
- âœ… 404.html fallback for client-side routing
- âœ… GitHub Actions automatic deployment
- âœ… Custom domain configuration
- âœ… SEO-optimized clean URLs
- âœ… No code changes required

This is the **industry-standard solution** for React SPAs on GitHub Pages with custom domains!
